# Welcome

Great. You've gotten this far.

Given that, we can assume:

1. You understand [how test coverage works in this project](https://github.com/afinetooth/coveralls-demo-ruby#1-understand-test-coverage-in-this-project). (If not, start back at the [README in the master branch](https://github.com/afinetooth/coveralls-demo-ruby).)

2. You've chosen Travis CI as your CI Service of choice. (If it's not, head back to the [README here](https://github.com/afinetooth/coveralls-demo-ruby#4-configure-this-project-to-use-coveralls), and choose a different service / branch.)
