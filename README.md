# Configure your project for Coveralls & CircleCI

[WIP]

#### Setup Notes / Steps
- [x] Add [`simplecov-lcov`](https://github.com/fortissimo1997/simplecov-lcov) gem and convert test coverage report into lcov format to use coveralls orb
- [x] Add [coveralls orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/coveralls/coveralls)
- [x] Configure orb's upload command with parameters: path_to_lcov & token
- [ ] Embed coverage badge (and probably circleci badge)
- [ ] Write README
