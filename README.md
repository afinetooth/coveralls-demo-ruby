# Coveralls & CircleCI

[WIP]

### Setup Notes / Steps
- [x] Add [`simplecov-lcov`](https://github.com/fortissimo1997/simplecov-lcov) gem and convert test coverage report into lcov format to use coveralls orb
- [x] Add [coveralls orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/coveralls/coveralls)
- [ ] Add `.coveralls.yml` with `REPO_TOKEN: <token>` (Where is this documented? [Here](https://docs.coveralls.io/supported-ci-services)? I had to find sample projects and copy their setup, [here](https://github.com/FarmBot/Farmbot-Web-App/blob/staging/.coveralls.yml) and [here](https://github.com/melbon/circleci-coveralls/blob/feat/add-square-tests/.coveralls.yml).)
